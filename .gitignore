# Except results we explicitly want (handled by git add, but safe to ignore by default to prevent accidental data commit)
# Actually user said "Ensure no dataset files (.npy) are uploaded".
# But allowed RESULTS_*.csv in root (which I moved to results/).
# I will allow .csv and .json generally but maybe ignore specific data folders?
# User said: "Ensure no dataset files (.npy) are uploaded."
# User also said: ".gitignore file including: .venv/, __pycache__/, *.npy, *.h5, *.pth, .DS_Store"
# So I will strictly follow that list.
